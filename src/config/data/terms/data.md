### 10. EXPERIENCES

10.1 Experiences which form part of your client's package: On occasion we are able to arrange various 'experiences', such as fishing, which you can pre-book on behalf of your client before departure and pay us for as part of your client's holiday arrangements. Some of these experiences may require your client to be in good physical and mental health and, by booking with us, you confirm that your client and their party are in good health with no medical history that would make it dangerous for them to participate. They must observe safety instructions at all times. We will only accept responsibility for these experiences in accordance with these booking conditions. The experiences may be subject to minimum numbers, and may be cancelled at short notice. In such circumstances, your client will receive a full refund of monies paid for the activity in question but we will not have any other liability (including compensation). Your client will not be entitled to cancel any other arrangements as a result without paying the applicable cancellation charges.

Your client's contract will therefore be with the local operator which provides it and it does not form part of your client's contracted holiday arrangements with us. The contract will be subject to the local operator's terms and conditions, some of which may exclude or limit its liability to your client, and will be governed by local law and jurisdiction. We accept no liability for any breach of contract or negligent act or omission of any excursion/activity provider.
