Our team will confirm the availability of the accommodation(s) for the dates intended.

Upon successful confirmation, you will receive instructions by email, as well as Pure Escapes IBAN and BIC codes that should allow you to perform the payment.

Please note that you have 24 hours only to perform the transfer and provide us with a payment confirmation. After this time frame, the provisional booking will be released.
